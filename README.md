# Mario Bros Assignment

In this project I further developed my C++ skills beyond the foundational knowledge I gained in the first semester to build a replica of the original 'Mario Bros' game using C++ and the SDL library.

This project was completed in the second semester of my 'Game Engine Creation' module in the first year of my 'Computer Games Development' degree at Staffordshire University.


## Tech Stack
* ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)
* SDL


## Features
- 2D Rendering
- AI
- Collisions (Bounding Box / Circle)
- Music & SFX
- User Input
- Player Movement
- Local multiplayer
- Win / Lose Conditions
- Text rendering
- Multiple Levels / Screens
- Data Persistence


## Goals & Requirements
To write a 2D game replicating the first level of 'Mario Bros' using C++ and the SDL library taking an object oriented development approach.


## Project Thinking
I followed the tutorials provided in order to complete the first level of the mario bros game to match the criteria set in the assignment brief. I then used my knowledge and the code written for level one to create a second more challenging level.


## Key Learnings
This project was an introduction into using C++ for games developed as well as my first experience developing a 2D game.
- I learnt the basics of 2D games development.
- Developed my C++ skills beyond the intial learning conducted in semester one.
- Explored using C++ for games development.
- Learnt the benefit of external libraries for projects.
- Appropriate programming standards

Overall, this was a very beneficial project early into my time at university that allowed me to learn the basics of 2D games development as well as further my C++ ability and programming standards which aided me further along into my degree.
